    "# 6 Pandas library\n",
    "# Pandas implements a more sophisticated numpy library.\n",
    "# The library functions much like Excel spreadsheets. Think \"np arrays\" but with\n",
    "# column header values and row header values, typically text fields that describe\n",
    "# the column or the row. Row headers are referred to as \"index\" values and column headers\n",
    "# are referred to as \"column\" values. If you execute len(series_name), you'll get the\n",
    "# number of rows in the Series. I think of this as the \"depth\" of the Series.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# See docs at: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Key concepts:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# First we have a data structure known as a Series. You can think of a Series as a\n",
    "# column vector of data. They operate much like a dictionary and indexed by the row index \"keys\".\n",
    "# The one difference with a series vs. a dictionary is that a Series has to contain element \n",
    "# values that are all of the same data type - be aware.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Second, multiple Series can be arranged into a 2-d matrix of Series called a\n",
    "# DataFrame. A 2-d data frame is a classic Excel Spreadhseet. The default row and\n",
    "# column header values are numbers that range from 0 to m-1, n-1, where m-1 is the number\n",
    "# rows and n-1 is the number of columns. Here's the tricky bit that I found, each\n",
    "# Series (dictionary) in a data frame has to have the same key values, i.e. the same row index\n",
    "# values. The index and column variables are not static, but can be updated programatically.\n",
    "# Once the index and column header values have been assigned (or not, i.e. using the\n",
    "# default values), sorting or otherwise rearranging the rows and columns in a data frame\n",
    "# does not result in changing the header values. So imagine a data frame:\n",
    "#\n",
    "#     A   B   C\n",
    "# 0   5   6   7\n",
    "# 1   10  60  30\n",
    "# 2   50  20  70\n",
    "#\n",
    "# And you rearrange (sort) the data frame on column B values, say from largest to smallest,\n",
    "# you'd get:\n",
    "#\n",
    "#     A   B   C\n",
    "# 1   10  60  30\n",
    "# 2   50  20  70\n",
    "# 0   5   6   7\n",
    "#\n",
    "# See that those row index values (0, 1, 2) \"follow along\" with the data.\n",
